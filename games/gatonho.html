    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">GATONHO</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
      Gatonho is a fearless cat on a quest through Bigato Hill! Jump, scratch, and roll to recover the four mystical rings.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
      ðŸ’¡ <strong>Tip:</strong> Use arrow keys and spacebar to play. On mobile, rotate your device and use the touch controls.
    </p>

  <!-- Manual Section -->
  <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 pb-20 leading-relaxed text-gray-200">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-center text-blue-400">Manual</h2>

    <p><strong>Use arrow keys to move and space bar to kick ass!</strong> Press F11 to select Easy (9 lives) or Normal (7 lives) and press F12 to restart when Catonny loses his 7 lives. Remember: In Brazil, cats have 7 lives!</p>

    <p class="mt-4">ðŸ¥‰ <strong>Bronze Trophy (3rd Place):</strong> Defeat Slime Jackson and recover the Street Soccer Cup.</p>
    <p>ðŸ¥ˆ <strong>Silver Trophy (2nd Place):</strong> Collect all 4 keys (blue, red, white, and green), defeat Slime Jackson, and recover the Street Soccer Cup.</p>
    <p>ðŸ¥‡ <strong>Gold Trophy (1st Place):</strong> Collect all 4 keys and all 4 rings (blue, red, white, and green) by using the keys on the matching-colored shacks. Then defeat Slime Jackson, recover the Street Soccer Cup, and claim the true Gold Trophy!</p>

    <p class="mt-6">Catonny is a cute little kitten born without arms, but he's incredibly brave! A villain, a pink Slime who imitates Prince Jackson, wearing a black hat and dancing shoes, stole the "Ring Cup"â€”the most important soccer championship from the Caterpillar Hills. Catonny chased after him, but took a wrong turn and got lost in the Back Hill, a place with streets that look like a maze. In this unknown neighborhood, everyone wants trouble with the residents of the Caterpillar Hills, and Catonny will have to kick his way through until he recovers the precious Ring Cup!</p>

    <p class="mt-4 italic text-gray-400">This game is made to run on the Atari 2600 videogame console.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-blue-400">FAQ</h3>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Does the game have an ending, or is it just about scoring points?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> The game has an ending. Points can help, but rememberâ€”itâ€™s all a game, and every game ends someday. So play until the finish and never give up. After all, tomorrow is another day!</p>

    <p class="mt-4"><strong>Q:</strong> Whatâ€™s that big-headed yellow creature that looks like an E.T.E.?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Thatâ€™s Gatonho! Donâ€™t worryâ€”heâ€™s not an E.T.E. Heâ€™s just a cat without arms, but he never falls into holes!</p>

    <p class="mt-4"><strong>Q:</strong> Whatâ€™s that colorful square in the middle at the start?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> In Atari games, imagination is essential. Imagine itâ€™s a treasure chest! Inside, thereâ€™s a 50% chance youâ€™ll find Gatonhoâ€™s dream: a square ball that grants +1 damage and ranged attacks.</p>

    <p class="mt-4"><strong>Q:</strong> Sometimes my kick doesnâ€™t work! Is this a bug?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Gatonhoâ€™s kick has a cooldown. After kicking, you must step back and wait.</p>

    <p class="mt-4"><strong>Q:</strong> Gatonhoâ€™s foot is so smallâ€”itâ€™s nearly impossible to hit anything!<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Gatonho has no arms, so he gives his entire being to that kickâ€”his whole body glows and deals damage. You can use the Atari difficulty switch to slow enemies down and practice, but this only leads to the Easy Ending.</p>

    <p class="mt-4"><strong>Q:</strong> What is that square thing he keeps kicking?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Thatâ€™s Gatonhoâ€™s dreamâ€”a square ball with +1 damage and ranged attack power.</p>

    <p class="mt-4"><strong>Q:</strong> A monster ate my square ball. What do I do?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Some creatures exist only to crush your dreams. You might think you can trade the ball for freedomâ€”but youâ€™ll need it again. Rats drop stolen balls.</p>

    <p class="mt-4"><strong>Q:</strong> A dog keeps killing me. What should I do?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Rhythm. The Doggy dashes forward in a fixed pattern. Just like dancing sambaâ€”one step forward, one step back.</p>

    <p class="mt-4"><strong>Q:</strong> Thereâ€™s a huge man in a white cloth hat, sleeping. What does he do?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> These are the Cat Kebab Cooks. They do nothingâ€”until someone joyful appears with a square ball. Kick your dream into his face and prove it can exist!</p>

    <p class="mt-4"><strong>Q:</strong> I died to a winged monster that looks like a bee. What was that?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Thatâ€™s Ozzy the Bat. He flies in zigzagsâ€”up and down. Defeat him with rhythm and rock!</p>

    <p class="mt-4"><strong>Q:</strong> What was that giant, pink, weirdly decorated monster that beat me by dancing?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Thatâ€™s the Slime Imitator of Prince Jackson. Defeat his mini-Slimes, collect keys, and find the real trophy hidden in the shacks!</p>
